This two tutorials have two ways of doing the color maps:

This is a ”static” map:
https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower/blob/master/tutorials/plotting_colormaps.ipynb 
cmap_list=[(0.975, "blue"), (1.0, "green"), (1.03, "red")]
cmap, norm = plot.cmap_continous(cmap_list)
bc = plot.create_bus_collection(net, net.bus.index, size=80, zorder=2, cmap=cmap, norm=norm)
plot.draw_collections([lc, bc], figsize=(8,6))


This is an interactive map with plotly:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/e2nIEE/pandapower/blob/develop/tutorials/plotly_built-in.ipynb 
from pandapower.plotting.plotly import pf_res_plotly
pf_res_plotly(net)
