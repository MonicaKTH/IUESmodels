Introduction
========================

The aim of this project is to make available models developed along the work published 
in the PhD thesis "A co-simulation based framework for the analysis of integrated urban 
energy systems" [M.Arnaudo]_.

The project folder contains sample scenarios that demonstrate the usage of the main co-simulation 
based models. These scenarios are called Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. 
They involve different energy systems, as described in the following sections. 
However, the approach to the models set up (:ref:`How-to-set-up-the-models`) 
and simulations run (:ref:`How-to-run-the-models`) is the same.
